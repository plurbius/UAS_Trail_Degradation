# UAS_Trail_Degradation
This repository houses the data and workflow for the drone collected trail degradation model used for John Lesko Master thesis. The thesis, and its methodology, can be access [here](....)

## Models

In the Models repository you will find python scripts used to measure each trail degradation characteristic (width, incision, grade, and rugosity), and the eventual trail degradation model. The background behind these analyses can be understood in the methodology section of the thesis linked above. 

## Project Data
Due to file size limitations, the data for this data is not stored in this repository. Instead, the orthomosaic, Digital Surface Model, Study areas, trail tread areas, as well as the model outputs for all of the trail degradation characteristics and trail degradation models can be access via a shared folder on google drive. The data is stored by trail as features classes in file geodatabases.
